## Permissions that the app needs

The permissions that the Texter app requires are: 


- Permissions to Set Alarm
- Permissions to Receive Boot Completed
- Permissions to Send SMS
- Permissions to Read Contacts

The app has not included the permission to use internet on your phone, so anything that the app has access to never leaves your phone.

Valuing user privacy, the Texter app has not requested the permission to read your phone's SMS, like a lot of the other texting apps do.

Below you will find details on each of the permissions requested.

## Permission To Set Alarm

The app requests the permission to set an alarm so that the app can set an alarm to know when it is time to send the text message that you have scheduled to be sent. Without this permission, it would not be possible for the app to know when it is time to send the scheduled text.


## Permission To Receive Boot Completed

When the phone shuts down or restarts, all the alarms for scheduled texts and reminders are canceled. To restore them, the app has requested to be notified when the phone is turned on, so that the app can restore all pending text schedules and reminders.


## Permission To Send SMS

This is the main permission that the app uses to send SMS to people that you choose.

## Permission To Read Contacts

When scheduling SMS, to make it easier for you, the app requests that it has permission to read your contacts so that it can show you a list of all your contacts that you can choose from, as recipients for your scheduled texts. Without this permission, you would have to manually look up phone numbers in your Contacts app and copy paste phone numbers one at a time. 
This was requested to make it more convinient for you to choose people that you want to text.


## Moreover

SMS is only sent to the people that you choose at the time that you choose, unless there is a small difference in time (since the Android System decides when it is most convenient for the alarm to go off).

The contacts that we read from your phone is not used for any other reason, other than to know who to text once you've picked those contacts.

The app has not requested internet access, so you can practically use the app with Cellular data and Wifi data turned off. Most phones can text without data and Wifi since the app can only send 'Text' only SMS.
